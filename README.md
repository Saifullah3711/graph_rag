# GraphRAG Chatbot

RAG-based chatbot implementation using Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Streamlit UI. This implementation uses Microsoft Research's GraphRAG approach, providing superior context awareness and reasoning capabilities compared to traditional RAG systems.

## ü§î Why GraphRAG?

Traditional RAG systems, while useful, face several limitations when dealing with complex information retrieval and reasoning tasks. GraphRAG addresses these limitations through a structured, hierarchical approach:

### Limitations of Traditional RAG:
1. **Limited Connection Synthesis**: Basic RAG struggles to "connect the dots" between related pieces of information that aren't explicitly linked
2. **Poor Holistic Understanding**: Traditional approaches have difficulty comprehending and summarizing broad semantic concepts across large document collections
3. **Context Loss**: Simple vector similarity search can miss important contextual relationships

### GraphRAG Advantages:
1. **Knowledge Graph Structure**: 
   - Creates an LLM-generated knowledge graph from your input corpus
   - Captures complex relationships between entities
   - Enables traversal of related concepts through shared attributes

2. **Hierarchical Understanding**:
   - Uses Leiden technique for hierarchical clustering
   - Generates community-level summaries
   - Provides both granular and holistic views of information

3. **Advanced Query Processing**:
   - **Global Search**: For reasoning about holistic questions across the entire corpus
   - **Local Search**: For detailed exploration of specific entities and their relationships

4. **Enhanced Context Window**:
   - Use community summaries for better context
   - Maintains relationship awareness during queries
   - Improves synthesis of information from multiple sources

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone it@github.com:Saifullah3711/graph_rag.git

cd graph_rag
```

2. Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add your OpenAI API key:
```
GRAPHRAG_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## üíª Usage

### Using Pre-provided Data
To run the chatbot with the pre-provided dataset:
```bash
streamlit run st_chatbot.py
```
This will launch the Streamlit interface in your default web browser.

### Using Your Own Data

To use your own data with the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Create an `input` folder in the root directory
   - Place your text documents (`.txt` files) in this folder
   > Note: Currently, only `.txt` files are supported

2. **Initialize GraphRAG**
```bash
python -m graphrag.index --init --root .
```

3. **Index Your Documents**
```bash
python -m graphrag.index --root .
```
This process will:
- Slice input corpus into analyzable TextUnits
- Extract entities, relationships, and key claims using LLM
- Perform hierarchical clustering
- Generate community summaries
- Create the necessary graph structure
- Index the content for efficient retrieval

4. **Launch the Chatbot**
```bash
streamlit run st_chatbot.py
```

## üõ† How It Works

GraphRAG follows a sophisticated process:

1. **Indexing Phase**:
   - Document Slicing: Breaks down documents into manageable TextUnits
   - Entity Extraction: Identifies key entities, relationships, and claims
   - Clustering: Groups related information using Leiden technique
   - Summary Generation: Creates hierarchical summaries of communities

2. **Query Phase**:
   - Global Search: For corpus-wide understanding
   - Local Search: For entity-specific exploration
   - Context Enhancement: Uses community structures for better responses

## üéØ Features

- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Graph-based retrieval
- Hierarchical information processing
- Community-aware responses
- Source tracking
- Context-rich answers
- Entity relationship mapping

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Currently supports only `.txt` files
- Requires OpenAI API key which could be costly for large documents
- Initial processing time for large documents
- Resource intensive for very large datasets
