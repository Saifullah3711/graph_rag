{"result": "The High Court in Zambia is a superior judicial body established by the Constitution, endowed with unlimited and original jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. It serves as a court of record and is responsible for handling significant legal cases. The High Court has the authority to determine questions regarding the validity of elections and membership of the National Assembly, and it hears applications related to the enforcement of protective provisions. It also plays a role in legal proceedings and reviews concerning restrictions or detentions, with qualified judges presiding over relevant tribunals.\n\nThe High Court consists of the Chief Justice and other judges, who are appointed by the President. These judges must have at least ten years of legal experience. The court is divided into specialized divisions, including the Industrial Relations Court, Commercial Court, Family Court, and Children’s Court, as determined by an Act of Parliament. Additionally, the High Court has appellate and supervisory jurisdiction and shares certain powers with the Public Protector, such as enforcing the attendance of witnesses.\n\nJudges of the High Court are eligible for roles like the Solicitor-General and Director of Public Prosecutions, and their remuneration is protected under Article 119. The High Court's provisions for the removal of judges are similar to those of the Supreme Court, ensuring a robust judicial framework within Zambia.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
