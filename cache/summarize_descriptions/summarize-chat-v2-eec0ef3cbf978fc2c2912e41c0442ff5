{"result": "The Chief Justice plays a crucial role in the governance and legal oversight concerning the President. The Chief Justice is responsible for appointing a board to investigate the President's capacity and certifying the President's incapacity when necessary. Additionally, the Chief Justice acts as the Returning Officer for elections and oversees the process of assessing the President's capacity, including appointing a tribunal for impeachment if required. Furthermore, the Chief Justice informs the President of resolutions passed by the National Assembly. On the other hand, the President has the authority to appoint the Chief Justice, although this appointment is subject to ratification by the National Assembly. This interdependent relationship highlights the checks and balances inherent in the system, ensuring that both the President and the Chief Justice have defined roles and responsibilities in maintaining the integrity of governance.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
