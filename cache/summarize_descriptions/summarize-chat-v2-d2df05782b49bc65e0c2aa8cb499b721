{"result": "The Supreme Court of Zambia is the highest judicial authority in the country, established by the Constitution. It serves as the final court of appeal, hearing cases from the Court of Appeal and the High Court, with leave from the Court of Appeal. The court is composed of the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice, and at least eleven other judges, all appointed by the President. Judges of the Supreme Court are required to have a minimum of fifteen years of legal experience. The court is a superior court of record, possessing the power to determine all matters except interlocutory matters, and operates with an uneven number of judges, not less than three, to ensure fair deliberation. The Supreme Court also holds the authority to address questions related to the validity of presidential elections. Its judges' remuneration is protected under Article 119, and they can be removed for inability, incompetence, or misbehavior as per constitutional provisions. The Supreme Court ranks equivalently with the Constitutional Court and is bound by its decisions, except when it is necessary to act in the interest of justice and the development of jurisprudence. Additionally, judges from the Supreme Court may be selected to form a tribunal, further emphasizing its role as a high judicial authority in Zambia.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
