{"result": "The President and the Cabinet have a dynamic and interdependent relationship in the governance structure. The Cabinet plays a crucial advisory role, providing guidance to the President on government policy. In certain situations, the Cabinet holds significant authority, such as the ability to resolve to investigate the President's capacity and propose motions for removal if necessary. Additionally, the Cabinet has the power to elect a member to perform the functions of the President if the Vice-President is unable to do so.\n\nThe President, on the other hand, acts on the advice of the Cabinet for specific decisions and consults with them before making critical declarations, such as declaring a state of public emergency or war. The President presides over Cabinet meetings, appoints its members, and has the authority to establish and dissolve government ministries and departments. This collaborative framework ensures that both the President and the Cabinet work together to maintain effective governance and respond to national challenges.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
